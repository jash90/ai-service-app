## Configuration

### AI Models
The app supports multiple AI models. You can configure them in `src/services/storage.ts`:

- OpenAI models (e.g., GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4)
- Perplexity models
- Add other providers as needed

### Speech Recognition
Speech recognition settings can be configured in the app settings:

- Recognition language
- Voice options
- Speech rate and pitch

## Usage

1. **Starting a Conversation**

   - Switch between threads easily

3. **Changing AI Models**
   - Tap "Change" next to the current model name
   - Select from available models in the model picker
   - Models require appropriate API keys

4. **Voice Settings**
